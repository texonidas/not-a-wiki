                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: because i dont see this point where undead are useful
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: the undead assistants are useless due to how much undead focus on offline boosts

                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: you want assistants? go fairy, which have assistants, assistant production upgrades, and don't lose 90% of production

                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: and undead are not worth the time
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: elves will make much more money than undead, much faster
                <p><b>Coolle</b>: and how would elves be able to carry someone idling through early game
                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: by actually producing gems
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: step 1: get sun blessing
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: step 2: cast moon blessing
                <p><b>reusens</b>: But if you need to unlock the faceless, undead seem alright to me, no?
                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: no
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: step 3: watch as gems rain from above
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: 36 hours as undead are 36 hours wasted
                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: once you settle for faceless unlock, you arent going to production
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: go angel and get autocast
                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: you would use dwarf-elves (for production) or dwarf-angel (for casts)
                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: actually, dwarf-fairy over dwarf-elves
                <p><b>Coolle</b>: ivanovich that might be true for first stage, but then the staged multipliers of other races will do just as well
                <p><b>Coolle</b>: forcing all players down a cookie cutter path is also like the dumbest way to present gaming
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: it's not my fault elves are just objectively better at early game than anyone else
                <p><b>Coolle</b>: you present functional options and let the player do whatever they want
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: actually, elves are better than anyone else pre-mercs till R39
                <p><b>ivanovichkoslov</b>: need only a couple titan runs in the middle between R0 to R7, but afterwards elvenline just makes anything else obsolete
                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: coolle: the cookie cutter path is right if the other path is just abysmally weaker
                <p><b>Coolle</b>: "right"
                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: undead suck, its objective
                <p><b>Coolle</b>: it's only right for the playstyle of running through your first early game
                <p><b>Coolle</b>: and missing out on the mechanics of the game
                <p><b>necrodoom</b>: if 5 min of active play is better than 1 day of offline play

                <p><b>Coolle</b>: he asked for options for offline
